                Stonebranch Capital LLC is a small, intentional parent company based in South Carolina.
                We exist to give our own brands—and select partner businesses—a stable operational
                foundation, modern customer experience, and the systems they need to grow.

        <p class="card-body">
          Our mission is to build reliable, efficient, modern operating systems for small
          businesses—whether they’re ventures we own or companies we support. We focus on
          clean operations, clear communication, and customer experiences that feel
          professional, respectful, and easy.
        </p>
        <p class="card-body">
          Every venture under Stonebranch should feel organized, predictable, and

        <h2 class="card-title">A portfolio that grows together, not apart.</h2>
        <p class="card-body">
          Our vision is to create a portfolio of service businesses and digital tools that
          share processes, systems, and standards. New projects shouldn’t have to start from
          zero; they should inherit what works and improve on it.
        </p>
        <p class="card-body">
          Stonebranch is especially committed to supporting veteran-owned and
          early-stage businesses where access to capital, time, and operational support is
          limited. For select partnerships, we use flexible models—including revenue-share or
          phased support—so we can align with long-term success instead of loading founders
          with up-front cost.
        </p>
        <p class="card-body about-fine-print">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Stonebranch Capital LLC is <em>not</em> a lender or
          funding company. We do not offer loans, lines of credit, or financial products.
          Our role is to help businesses gain and retain customers, improve operations,
          and build stable revenue—not to sell financing.

                Stonebranch Capital is led by a U.S. military veteran with experience in
                emergency services, operations, and service-based business development.
                That background shows up in how we think: clear chains of responsibility,
                checklists, training, and systems that still work on hard days—not just
                on paper.
